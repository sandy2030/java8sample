Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.

In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily
talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.

That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and
dependencies.

-------------------------------
Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger
structures.

The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.

These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other
classes.
--------------------------------
Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used
when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

But everyone knows an object is created by using new keyword in java. For example:

StudentRecord s1=new StudentRecord();

Hard-Coded code is not the good programming approach. Here, we are creating the instance by using the
new keyword. Sometimes, the nature of the object must be changed according to the nature of the program.
In such cases, we must get the help of creational design patterns to provide more general and flexible
approach.
